## Features

### User Interface:

- **Monitoring User Activities:** Admins can monitor user activities, including transactions and messages.
- **Message Management:** Admins can read messages received from users.

### Database Integration:
- **SQLite:** All data for users is stored in an SQLite database, including the following information:

Name: Users' names are stored for identification purposes.
Phone Number: Contact details such as phone numbers are saved to facilitate communication.
Address: Users' addresses are stored to provide location-specific services.
Account Number: Each user is assigned a unique account number for transactional purposes.
Balance: The balance of each user's account is recorded and updated with each transaction.
When transactions are made, the balances of both the sender and receiver are updated accordingly to reflect the new values.

This comprehensive storage of user data allows for efficient management of accounts and ensures a smooth banking experience for users.

## Development Details

The project utilized Python's Django framework, Bootstrap for the front-end, and SQLite for database storage. It offers comprehensive banking functionalities for both users and administrators, ensuring secure transactions and efficient management of user accounts and activities.
